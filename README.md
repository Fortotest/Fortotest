## 🧩 Who I Am  

I’m a **Digital Business student** and **freelance advertiser** who loves building and branding in equal measure.  
Started as a **graphic designer** in 2020 (Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma), and now expanding into **AI-driven business tools** and **digital marketing automation**.  

I’ve run ads across:
- **Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram)** — driving traffic to WhatsApp Business  
- **TikTok Ads & TikTok Shop** — optimizing conversion funnel through creative testing  
- **E-commerce & brand campaigns** — combining analytics + design + strategy  

I’m not just selling — I’m learning how data, design, and tech can *scale ideas faster*.
